description: Breaking and entering for a job? Yah, it's a thing. Must be good with locks. Bonus points for hacking a security system and disabling alarms.

## Finding and exploiting real world vulnerabilities

Physical penetration testing, often referred to as "physical pentesting," is a cybersecurity assessment technique that involves assessing the security of physical facilities, such as buildings, data centers, or other on-site assets. [It exposes weaknesses in physical security by simulating real-world scenarios to help test vulnerabilities and risks that could compromise a company’s physical security](https://thecyphere.com/blog/physical-penetration-testing/).

Companies that spend a lot of resources and time to secure their digital infrastructure, but lack physical security, leave themselves vulnerable to a two-faced threat. Cybersecurity teams will not be resilient if a malicious actor accesses a physical space and has access to private information or steals company devices.

Here are some common tactics malicious actors take to exploit physical security.

### Reconnaissance

90% of hacking is information gathering. Malicious actors have access to a wealth of information thanks to the modern internet. To take advantage of the internet, they can deploy [Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)](https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-open-source-intelligence/) gathering looking at various sources such as public records and social media sites.

With public records, malicious actors can access addresses, phone numbers, emails, and other personal information of an individual or entity. Several social media sites, such as Facebook or LinkedIn, may house critical information of an individual target:

- Their employer
- Their job
- Friends
- Family
- etc.

Social media and apps like Google Maps can also have details of a physical building. For example, photos from these platforms can provide information about the physical environment, such as the layout of a building, and work habits of employees. With enough information processed, a malicious actor can be well armed to plan and carry out a an attack.

### Tailgating

With enough information to work off, malicious actors may not need "brute force" attacks to break into a building. If they study the work habits of employees, malicious actors can just follow an employee when they enter and leave work, or when they leave and come back from lunch break. This tactic is known as **[tailgating](https://purplesec.us/physical-penetration-testing/#Tailgating)**.

Sometimes it could just be a matter of asking someone inside the organization to let them in once they get close enough. If you look like you belong, then you belong. Combined with social engineering, they can put pressure on the employee and enter the building without much questioning.

From that point on, the attacker can try and gain access to restricted areas by pretending to be an authorized person.

### Social engineering

### Blackmailing

### RFID hacks

### Lockpicking

### Security/systems manipulation

## Securing the fort

I analyzed various methods in which malicious actors can gain unauthorized access to a physical building. Now, it's time to talk about ways to secure physical spaces.

### Empower your employees

Mistakes happen. Even the smartest and most experience in cybersecurity can be fooled or hacked. What's important is to learn from your mistakes and educate people.
