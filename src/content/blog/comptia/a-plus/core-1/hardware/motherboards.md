## Form factors

The fundamental physical component within all of our computers is the motherboard. The motherboard generally contains the CPU, spaces for memory. There’s connectivity to power. You’ve got additional slots that you can use to expand the capabilities of the system. And everything involving the entire process of using your computer begins and ends with the motherboard.

As you can imagine, there are different motherboards that have different sizes depending on your requirements. We’ll look at some of the most popular sizes that are in use today. There’s usually a basic layout on these motherboards regardless of the size because most motherboards will include a CPU or slots for memory or expansion. But the amount of expansion slots and the amount of additional memory slots may vary depending on the size of the motherboard.

One thing that doesn’t seem to change much between motherboard versions, though, is the power connector. All of these power connectors are very standardized. And to keep compatibility through all of these different systems, you’ll find that most motherboards will use the same type of power connection. We generally choose a motherboard based on the size of the case we might own or how much future expansion we might need. And in some cases, we might choose a motherboard based on how much airflow is required to keep that system cool.

If you look at Wikipedia, there are over 40 different sizes and types of motherboards. Thankfully, there are only two or three that are very popular, and generally, you’ll find motherboards that are relatively compatible between the different cases. The big difference will be how many features and how much room do you need for this motherboard.

The CompTIA exam objectives tend to focus on which motherboard you might choose for a particular task and how you might install that particular motherboard. You wouldn’t generally have to memorize exact dimensions of a particular motherboard models, and generally, you’re choosing between two or three different motherboard types to answer one of these questions. For example, which motherboard would you use if you’re putting together a media center? Maybe you have a video editing system, or maybe you’re using a thin client. There’s different motherboards and different sizes for each of these scenarios. So it’s useful to understand when you would use a particular motherboard for a particular task.

The CompTIA exam objectives focus on two different motherboard families. One is the ATX family, and the other is the ITX family. The standard ATX is the motherboard that you’d most likely find in a desktop computer. It has a lot of real estate, plenty of expansion slots, lots of memory, and there’s plenty of room inside of a desktop for this size of motherboard. You might use ATX on a desktop system, but a Mini-ITX motherboard might be perfect for the small form factor computer that you keep next to your television.

These larger desktop motherboards are advanced technology extended motherboards or ATX. It’s a standard that’s been around since 1995, and it’s one that’s become very popular for desktop computers. If you’re buying a computer for a desktop today, you’re probably buying an ATX motherboard. There have been a number of updates to the ATX standard over the years. So the ATX motherboard you find today will probably have a power connector that’s 20 or 24 pins in size, and there may be additional power on the motherboard for CPU.

If you need more of a smaller form factor for your motherboard, you might want to look at an ITX motherboard. This is a style of motherboard that was created by VIA Technologies in 2001, and it’s perfect for small form factors and smaller cases. Although this is relatively small compared to ATX, the screw holes in this motherboard are exactly the same as an ATX motherboard. So you could even install this very small motherboard into a much larger case that was originally designed for ATX.

But the real value of these smaller motherboards is that you can fit them into much smaller cases which can then fit into much smaller areas. I mentioned earlier having a computer right next to your television, and in those cases, it would be nice to have something in a much smaller case instead of having a full size desktop system right next to your media center.

## Expansion slots

If you look at a motherboard, there are a lot of different components that are attached to these systems. There’s CPU and memory and storage and expansion slots, and there needs to be some way that all of these different components can communicate with each other. There are also times when we might want to add additional functionality to our motherboard by adding an expansion card into one of the available slots. And that expansion card needs some way to communicate with the memory and the CPU.

If you’re working with an older computer, you may see some expansion slots on that computer that are PCI. This is Peripheral Component Interconnect, and it’s a standard that’s been around since 1994. PCI has different bus sizes that could be used. There’s a 32-bit PCI bus and a 64-bit PCI bus. And these communicate using parallel communication.

The 64-bit expansion slot is effectively the same thing. We still have parallel communication and sending all 64 bits across the bus at the same time. But obviously, the 64-bit bus is twice as large as the 32-bit bus. Physically, the 64-bit interfaces are also much larger than the 32-bit.

On newer computers, you probably won’t find a PCI bus. Instead, you’ll find the newer PCI express bus. You’ll sometimes see this written as PCIe with the lowercase e. This effectively replaces PCI, and it changes the way we communicate across this bus. Instead of a parallel connection, PCI express uses a serial connection. And the communication path that it uses to communicate between these PCI express devices is called a PCI express lane.

Just as you add more lanes to a highway to support more traffic, you can add more lanes to a PCI express bus to support the transfer of more data. You’ll see these lanes referred to as a 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 full-duplex lane. These are written with an x at the beginning, so you’ll sometimes see x1, x2, x4, and so on. Normally, we would pronounce this with the x being a by. So this is a by 1, by 2, by 8, or by 32, for example.

You want to make sure that you have everything lined up properly with the card and that you’re not pushing too hard. If the card is not installing, then you should pull it back out, have a look at the different settings on your card and on the slot, and then try installing the card again. If you have everything aligned, then this card should slide into the slot very easily, and you can lock it in place with the screw connection on the case.

## Connectors

One of the largest connectors on your motherboard is one that is providing power directly from the power supply to the motherboard. This provides main motherboard power at 3.3 volts plus or minus 5 volts and plus or minus 12 volts. Originally, this was a 20-pin connector. And as the years have gone by, we’ve needed some additional power for the motherboard.

So now, the standard size for this motherboard power connector is a 24-pin connector. If you have a motherboard with an older 20-pin connector, you can still plug in this 24-pin connector and use it. Some power supplies even have this connector modular, so it has 20 pins and then you can attach 4 more pins to it.

Before connecting the power supply to the motherboard, you want to first make sure that you’ve disconnected from all power sources and then connect that directly into the motherboard with the orientation that matches the keys on the individual pins. On this particular connector, there is a lock on the side of it that corresponds with this lip that is coming off the end of the connector so that, when you push it down into the connector, it locks in place. And this will not move out of that connection until you push down and unlock it from the power connector.

Some motherboards will have different types of connections. They may be in a different layout, or they may be a different color. But all of this is exactly the same SATA connection, and you would use these connections for any of your storage devices. There may be situations where you don’t have any room to install a new drive inside of your computer case or perhaps you have an external drive that you would like to use.

In those cases, you might want to use an eSATA connection for external Serial ATA. That external connection is usually provided with a built-in interface on the motherboard. Or in this particular example, it’s an expansion card that adds additional eSATA connectors to the back of this computer. This allows us to connect an external storage device, but we still have the same throughput and performance as an internal SATA connection.

Another important set of connectors on your motherboard are the headers. Sometimes, you’ll hear these referred to as “pin headers,” because they are groups of pins that are on the edge of the motherboard. There’s usually a single large connector or a number of smaller individual wires that would connect to all of these pin headers. These might provide power or have USB connectivity, or they might provide the button connectivity that you have on the outside of your computer case.

Many computer cases have an on/off button on the case. There might be a reset button, and there might be other controls as well. The way that you integrate those buttons with the motherboard itself is through connectors that are provided on the case. These connectors are even labeled. These are the connectors used for the reset switch.

You might also find on your motherboard an M.2 connector. This is on newer motherboards that can support connectivity using this M.2 standard. One very common use of these M.2 connectors is to plug in an SSD and be able to have all of your storage on this very small device connected to the motherboard. To use this, you would simply plug into the M.2 connector on the motherboard. You would push the drive all the way into the M.2 connector and then fasten it to the motherboard with a screw. This will ensure that whatever you’re connecting into that M,2 interface will be firmly fastened to the motherboard itself.

## Compatibility

If you’re building your own computer, one of the first decisions you’ll need to make are whether this will be an Intel-based motherboard or an AMD-based motherboard. These are two very popular CPU manufacturers. And all of the other systems on your motherboard will be based around this decision. This decision might be based on the cost of the motherboard and the CPU.

Some combinations of motherboards and CPUs are different, depending on whether they are Intel-based or AMD-based. And sometimes the most inexpensive device is the one that generally wins. Once you make the decision on whether you’re going with an AMD-based motherboard or an Intel-based motherboard, you’re effectively locked into that decision. You can’t remove an AMD CPU and replace it with an Intel CPU.

Not only are the CPUs very different in how they are designed and how they operate, but the sockets themselves are very different between manufacturers. Whether you go with Intel or AMD, the decision is usually based on a number of criteria. Traditionally, we thought of AMD as being the more cost-effective CPU and Intel as having the more powerful CPU. But you’ll find that these two criteria change quite a bit as time goes on. And you’ll have to check the specifications for your motherboard and your CPU to see if you’re getting exactly what you want out of that system.

The installation of the CPU is very similar, regardless of which manufacturer’s motherboard you go with. Usually, there’s a cover that holds the CPU in place. You would lift that cover, simply place the CPU into the socket, and then bring the cover back down to lock it in place. If you’re designing a system that will be used as a server, then you’re probably configuring a motherboard that has multiple CPU sockets on it. This might allow you to start with a single CPU and upgrade it to dual CPUs later or to simply install it with two CPUs to support a higher load.

With laptops, we tend to focus on portability. So the motherboard you would have in a laptop tend to be very small and very light. The CPUs in a laptop are not necessarily designed for speed but instead for power usage and efficiency. And since there’s no space inside of these laptops for much cooling, the CPUs are designed to throttle when the system becomes warmer. That way you’re able to have the system continue to work but not damage itself through any type of overheating.

Laptops are also much less customizable than a desktop system. With the desktop, we can take the cover off. We can add new capabilities into the expansion slots. We can swap out memory or CPU. But in a laptop, it’s very difficult to gain access to all of that inside of the system. So on your laptop, you may not have many options available for memory upgrades, any changes to the CPU, or modifying or adding on any additional features to the existing motherboard.

The goal with these motherboards is to have something that is as portable as possible but also something that does not use a lot of power and can run for a very long time from battery. Unlike desktops, where you can remove one ATX motherboard and replace it with another ATX motherboard, you don’t have quite the same flexibility with a laptop system. Laptop motherboards are usually proprietary. And they’re often specifically built and designed for that specific laptop model.

If you need to replace the motherboard, you have to replace it with the exact type of motherboard design for that laptop. And since your interfaces, your CPU, your memory, and other features are part of that system board, if any part of that happens to stop working, you’ve got to replace the entire motherboard.

## The BIOS

When you start your computer, something has to begin the process of loading an operating system. On most of our personal computers, this is the BIOS, the Basic Input Output System. This is the software that starts up when you hit that power button.

This is sometimes referred to as the firmware of your system. It’s the system BIOS or the ROM BIOS, or in some cases, the ROM or flash memory. These days, we don’t generally use Read Only Memory or ROM. Almost everything relating to the BIOS today is stored in flash memory. When you power on your system, it initializes the memory and the CPU, and it begins executing the code of the BIOS.

After the CPU and memory is initialized, you have the post or power on self-test. This is not a comprehensive hardware diagnostics. It’s merely checking to see if you have memory, CPU, video, and some type of input, such as a keyboard or mouse. If all of those components are in place, your BIOS will look to see what you’ve configured to be the boot drive, and then it will look for a boot loader installed on that boot drive so that it can start the operating system.

The flash memory used by the BIOS can usually be found on your motherboard. This motherboard has two separate BIOS configurations, one that is a main BIOS config and a backup BIOS config. This allows you to upgrade the BIOS on your system. And if something goes wrong with the upgrade, you can revert back to the previous version. If you’re working with an older computer, you might have a text-based BIOS like this one. This is the legacy BIOS, and it’s the one that’s been around for about 25 years. Most older operating systems were able to interact with the hardware using this legacy BIOS.

We can make very basic configuration changes from this legacy BIOS, but there’s no way to change or upgrade the capabilities of this BIOS. There’s no way to add additional drivers so that you can connect different network interfaces, and there’s no way to somehow interact or add on to the capabilities of the BIOS itself. The BIOS that’s in our most modern computers is called a UEFI BIOS. The UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, and it is a standard form of BIOS that can be used across multiple manufacturers.

This is a standard that was created by Intel called the EFI standard or the Extensible Firmware Interface standard. It allows many different manufacturers to create a BIOS that all is standardized on the same features and capabilities. It’s designed to replace a legacy BIOS. So any of the new computers you use today will be using a UEFI BIOS instead of the traditional legacy BIOS.

The next category over is the security category. So if you’d like to add a user or administrator password, you would do all of these settings from the security area of this particular UEFI BIOS. There’s also an Advanced tab at the top so you can change things like the boot options to determine how your system should start up. And this last tab is for UEFI drivers, which is a UEFI-specific capability. This allows you to install additional hardware drivers so that you can interact with other components that may be connected to your computer, such as a network interface card storage or any other hardware device on that system.

## BIOS Settings

## CPU Features

Most of the latest operating systems are 64-bit architectures. But you might find older operating systems still running that are 32-bit architectures. These are referring to the architecture of the CPU that is running on the motherboard of that system. And usually, it’s either a 32-bit or a 64-bit architecture.

A 32-bit processor can access up to 2 to the 32nd power of information. That is just over 4 billion values that can be accessed in that operating system. If you have a 64-bit architecture, that goes up dramatically to a 2 to the 64th power, which is an extremely large amount of data.

If you were to look at this as to how much memory you can store in a system, a 32-bit processor can access 4 gigabytes of information, whereas a 64-bit processor can access 17 billion gigabytes of information. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the 64-bit operating system you’re using can access 17 billion gigabytes, because most operating systems will have a maximum supported value for the OS.

If you want to see the system type in your Windows system, you can go to the Control Panel under the System settings, and it will tell you the system type. In this example, I’m using a 64-bit operating system with an x64-based processor.

The hardware drivers that you install must match the type of operating system you’re using. So if you’re using a 32-bit operating system, then you need to use 32-bit hardware drivers. If you have a 64-bit operating system, then you need to use a 64-bit hardware driver. Sometimes you’ll see this 32-bit software abbreviated as x86 software. This is a reference back to the Intel 8086 line of processors. If it’s a 64-bit processor, we abbreviate that as an x64.

It’s also important to know that if you’re using a 32-bit operating system, that you cannot run 64-bit applications in that OS. Conversely, if you’re running a 64-bit operating system, you can not only run 64-bit applications, but you can also run 32-bit applications as well. If you don’t know if the applications you’re using in Windows have been written for a 64-bit operating system or a 32-bit operating system, you can look to see where they’ve been installed. 32-bit applications are installed under Program Files x86 and 64-bit apps are simply installed under Program Files.

There’s another family of operating systems called the Advanced Risk Machine, or ARM. This is an architecture that was developed by ARM Limited. They designed the specifications for the hardware, and then third parties use those specifications to create ARM-based CPUs. The ARM architecture is well known for being extremely efficient and fast in its processing. It uses less power, creates less heat, and it’s perfect for our mobile devices. Although we commonly see ARM used for mobile devices and internet of things, the capabilities of ARM-based architectures are greatly expanding. And we’re starting to blur the lines a bit between the traditional 64-bit operating systems and the ARM-based operating systems.

We often refer to a CPU, or a Central Processing Unit, as a single, monolithic device. All the information goes into the CPU, and then we get results out of the CPU. But inside of the CPU, there are lot of individual components. The main processing of a CPU occurs on the processor core. And generally, in today’s CPUs, there are multiple cores that are on a single physical CPU package. Sometimes we refer to these as dual core, quad core, or simply multi-core. And newer processors are increasing the number of cores in our operating systems all the time.

It’s also not unusual for the multiple cores to also have multiple caches. These might have caches that are dedicated for a core, or there may be shared caches that are used across all of the cores. These caches are designed to help speed the processing of information into and out of the CPU.

In reality, we’re not getting twice the amount of work from one single device. Instead, it simply increases the throughput of the processes going through the CPU by somewhere around 15% to 30%. Not only do you need a CPU that supports hyper-threading, but your operating system also has to support it as well. Today any modern operating system supports hyper-threading. And if you bring up some CPU monitoring, you’ll very quickly see the results of this hyper-threading technology.

Many CPUs also include hardware that allow us to virtualize additional operating systems on our computer. This means that we could load Windows as our primary desktop, and inside of Windows, we could run other Windows instances, or instances of other operating systems, such as Linux. Virtualization itself is resource intensive. So it made sense to take a lot of that functionality that normally would be in software and put it directly into the hardware of the CPU.

If you have an Intel processor in your system, you can check your BIOS and see if it supports the Intel Virtualization Technology or VT. If you’re running an AMD processor, then you may be running AMD Virtualization, or AMD-V. Some virtualization software requires that you enable these capabilities in your CPU. So check with your documentation and your BIOS to make sure you’re using the proper configurations for your virtualization system.
